# MRI Super-Resolution Project

This repository contains code and notebooks for MRI super-resolution experiments using PyTorch.

## Structure
- `preprocessing.py`: Dataset and preprocessing utilities
- `pytorch-tutorial.ipynb`: Main notebook for experiments
- `test-lab.ipynb`: Additional tests and experiments

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo or copy your files here.
2. Set up a Python environment (e.g., with venv or conda).
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision nibabel matplotlib pandas tqdm scikit-image
   ```
4. Place your MRI data in the appropriate folders as referenced in the code.

## Usage
- Run the notebooks for interactive exploration.
- Use `preprocessing.py` for dataset loading and patch extraction.
